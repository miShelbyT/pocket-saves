# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


## Pocket Link Saves ðŸ“š

This app was "vibe coded" using ChatGPT. Dependencies include: 
* react-router-dom for client side routing
* lucide-react for "Add Link" hyperlink icon
* tailwind, postcss and autoprefixer for most css styles
* json-server to mock a lightweight JSON backend API

The user can view (or visit) their saved links, add a link, add/edit/remove tags on existing links, and delete links. To use this application: 
* fork and clone the Github repo
* in the terminal (root of the application), type `npm install` to install node modules from the package.json
* type `npm run server` to start the json-server
* in a separate terminal, type `npm run dev` to start the react server on port 5173

* if the user wants to import their own links from a csv file, there is a script to handle this. Simply drop the csv values into `your-file.csv` From the root of the application run `node fresh-db.js`. This will populate a new file called new-db.json, instead of overwriting the existing file. The in line 8 of package.json replace this: ```"server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 4000"```, with this: ```"server": "json-server --watch new-db.json --port 4000"```
* if the user wants to clean their database to update ids to be incremental and starting from 1, and to ensure that each item in the db has a tags array, just run `node clean-db.js`
